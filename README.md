# Valkey MCP Task Management Server

This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for task management that integrates with Valkey for persistence. The server allows agentic AI tools to create, manage, and track tasks across multiple projects and sessions.

## Purpose

The MCP Task Management Server provides a mechanism for agentic AI systems to:
- Plan and break down large tasks into smaller, manageable tasks
- Store tasks persistently across multiple sessions
- Allow users to review, update, and reorder tasks
- Track progress on projects over time

## Architecture

The system is built with the following components:
- **API Layer**: MCP-compatible endpoints for task/project operations
- **Service Layer**: Business logic for task management
- **Data Layer**: Valkey integration using Valkey-Glide client
