        "description": "Add comprehensive notes functionality to Valkey Tasks at both project and task levels to improve context management for agentic AIs. This will allow AIs to maintain important context between sessions, track decisions, document progress, and improve collaboration.\n\n## Design Decisions\n- Notes will support Markdown formatting for rich content\n- Notes will be stored as text fields in the Valkey database\n- Both projects and tasks will have notes fields\n- Dedicated MCP tools will be provided for notes management\n- Notes will be included in all relevant API responses\n\n## Implementation Approach\n- Add notes fields to existing models without breaking compatibility\n- Extend repository methods to handle notes data\n- Update MCP tools to support notes in all operations\n- Create comprehensive tests for notes functionality\n- Document usage patterns for effective agent workflows",
        "notes": "# Notes Feature Implementation - Process Notes\n\n## Task Completion Process\nAfter a task is finished, the full list of tasks (including their status) should be displayed so that we can validate whether we still want to proceed with the next task. This helps with:\n\n1. Reviewing overall progress\n2. Making informed decisions about next steps\n3. Potentially reprioritizing remaining tasks\n4. Identifying any dependencies or issues\n\n## Implementation Progress\n- Core functionality for notes has been implemented in models, repositories, and MCP tools\n- Unit tests have been cancelled in favor of integration tests\n- Integration tests have been completed for both plan and task notes\n- Tests verify proper storage, retrieval, and error handling for notes\n- Special character handling has been tested and confirmed working\n\n## Next Steps\n- Update documentation\n- Create example agent prompts\n",
