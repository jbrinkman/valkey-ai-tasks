```

### Creating Tasks with Notes

```
For the "E-commerce Platform" plan, create the following tasks with appropriate priorities:

1. "Set up microservices architecture" (high priority) with notes:
   # Microservices Setup

   ## Components
   - User service
   - Product service
   - Order service
   - Payment service
   - Inventory service

   ## Technology Stack
   - Go for backend services
   - PostgreSQL for persistent data
   - Redis for caching
   - gRPC for inter-service communication

   ## Implementation Steps
   1. Define service boundaries
   2. Create service templates
   3. Set up Docker containers
   4. Configure service discovery

2. "Implement product catalog" (medium priority) with notes:
   # Product Catalog Implementation

   ## Data Model
   ```json
   {
     "product": {
       "id": "string",
       "name": "string",
       "description": "string",
       "price": "number",
       "categories": ["string"],
       "attributes": {
         "key": "value"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   ## API Endpoints
   - GET /products - List all products
   - GET /products/{id} - Get product details
   - POST /products - Create new product
   - PUT /products/{id} - Update product
   - DELETE /products/{id} - Delete product

3. "Design user authentication flow" (high priority)
```

## Maintaining Context Between Sessions

### Updating Plan Notes with Progress

```
Update the notes for the "E-commerce Platform" plan to include the following information:

# E-commerce Platform Project

## Objectives
- Build a scalable e-commerce platform
- Support multiple payment gateways
- Implement inventory management
- Create a responsive user interface

### Documenting Technical Decisions in Task Notes

```
Update the notes for the "Set up microservices architecture" task with the following technical decisions:

# Microservices Setup

## Components
- User service
- Product service
- Order service
- Payment service
- Inventory service

## Technology Stack
- Go for backend services
- PostgreSQL for persistent data
- Redis for caching
- gRPC for inter-service communication

## Implementation Steps
1. Define service boundaries âœ…
2. Create service templates âœ…
3. Set up Docker containers âœ…
4. Configure service discovery ðŸ”„

## Technical Decisions

### Service Discovery
After evaluating Consul, etcd, and Kubernetes native service discovery, we've decided to use Kubernetes service discovery for the following reasons:
- Simplifies deployment model
- Native integration with our planned infrastructure
- Reduces operational complexity
- Built-in load balancing

### Database Per Service
Each microservice will have its own database to ensure:
- Loose coupling between services
- Independent scaling
- Isolation of data concerns

### API Gateway
We'll implement an API Gateway using Envoy because:
- High performance
- Extensible architecture
- Strong community support
- Built-in observability features

## Code Examples

### Service Template

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "net"
    "os"

    "google.golang.org/grpc"
    pb "github.com/example/service/proto"
)

func main() {
    port := os.Getenv("PORT")
    if port == "" {
        port = "50051"
    }
    
    lis, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":"+port)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("failed to listen: %v", err)
    }
    
    s := grpc.NewServer()
    pb.RegisterServiceServer(s, &server{})
    
    log.Printf("server listening at %v", lis.Addr())
    if err := s.Serve(lis); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("failed to serve: %v", err)
    }
}
```
```

## Collaborative Workflows

### Handoff Between Team Members

```
Review the "E-commerce Platform" plan and all its tasks. Update the plan notes to include this handoff information:

# Team Handoff (2025-06-23)

## Current Status
- Microservices architecture design is complete
- User authentication service is 70% implemented
- Product catalog API is functional but needs pagination
- CI/CD pipeline is configured but needs test automation

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete user authentication service
2. Add pagination to product catalog API
3. Implement test automation in CI/CD pipeline
4. Start work on payment service integration

## Known Issues
- Performance bottleneck in product search functionality
- Docker container for Redis occasionally fails to start
- Authentication token expiration needs to be configurable

```

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Documenting Issues and Solutions

```
Update the notes for the "Set up microservices architecture" task to include troubleshooting information:

# Troubleshooting Log

## Issue: Service Discovery Failure
**Date:** 2025-06-22
**Symptoms:** Services unable to discover and communicate with each other
**Root Cause:** DNS resolution issues in Kubernetes cluster
**Solution:**
1. Updated CoreDNS configuration
2. Added explicit DNS policy to pod specifications
3. Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff

**Code Fix:**
```go
func getServiceClient(ctx context.Context, serviceName string) (client.ServiceClient, error) {
    var serviceClient client.ServiceClient
    var err error
    
    backoff := retry.NewExponentialBackOff()
    backoff.MaxElapsedTime = 30 * time.Second
    
    retryFn := func() error {
        serviceClient, err = client.NewServiceClient(ctx, serviceName)
        return err
    }
    
    err = retry.Retry(retryFn, backoff)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to connect to service %s after retries: %w", serviceName, err)
    }
    
    return serviceClient, nil
}
```

## Issue: Database Connection Pooling
**Date:** 2025-06-23
**Symptoms:** Services experiencing intermittent database timeouts under load
**Root Cause:** Insufficient connection pool configuration
**Solution:**
1. Increased max connections in pool
2. Added connection lifetime management
3. Implemented circuit breaker pattern

**Configuration:**
```yaml
database:
  max_open_conns: 25
  max_idle_conns: 10
  conn_max_lifetime: 5m
  conn_max_idle_time: 1m
```
```
