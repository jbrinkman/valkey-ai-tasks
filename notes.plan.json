        "description": "Add comprehensive notes functionality to Valkey Tasks at both project and task levels to improve context management for agentic AIs. This will allow AIs to maintain important context between sessions, track decisions, document progress, and improve collaboration.\n\n## Design Decisions\n- Notes will support Markdown formatting for rich content\n- Notes will be stored as text fields in the Valkey database\n- Both projects and tasks will have notes fields\n- Dedicated MCP tools will be provided for notes management\n- Notes will be included in all relevant API responses\n\n## Implementation Approach\n- Add notes fields to existing models without breaking compatibility\n- Extend repository methods to handle notes data\n- Update MCP tools to support notes in all operations\n- Create comprehensive tests for notes functionality\n- Document usage patterns for effective agent workflows",
